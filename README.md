vs-welcome-page
===============

When you open a solution, this extension automatically looks for a ReadMe
file and renders and displays it in the embedded Visual Studio web browser.

This allows you to provide easy-to-find documentation for new team members,
or others who are new to your project.

It supports [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text, meaning that it works completely transparently for
GitHub projects, and has preliminary support for GitHub wiki pages.

Feel free to visit the [home page](http://rlipscombe.github.io/vs-welcome-page).
You can download it from the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0aff56ff-edf3-4939-a8f5-400f1279ac2a).

The [source code](https://github.com/rlipscombe/vs-welcome-page) is on github; and the wiki is [here](https://github.com/rlipscombe/vs-welcome-page/wiki).
